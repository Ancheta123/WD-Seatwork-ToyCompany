  Founded in 2024, House of Wonders engages in stuffed toys to bring you the wonders of that warm, nostalgic childhood feeling as we believe that it is never too old to have something as warm as a fuzzy toy as a companion.
  House of Wonders first opened its doors in Metro Manila with the first collaboration with Pusheen as part of its grand opening. With plans to expand beyond the first three product series, our goal is to bring you one step closer to a place where you can find comfort and make you feel like you are home.

## Rules, Practices and Principles

2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
